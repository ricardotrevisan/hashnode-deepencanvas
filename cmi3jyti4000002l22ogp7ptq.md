In The Intention Economy (2012), Doc Searls foresaw a world where the market would respond to consumer intention — not to advertising.
A scenario where power would return to the user and intermediaries — ads, marketplaces, influence algorithms — would fade away.

“When the customer declares what they want, companies compete to serve them.”

More than a decade later, that vision finds its technical base: the Web Agentic — an internet where autonomous AI agents interact, negotiate, and execute actions on their own.

Automation advances to the strategic level.
Corporate agents begin orchestrating APIs, analyzing real-time data, negotiating contracts, and continuously monitoring risks.
The promise: efficiency, consistency, and new value models.

The interface ceases to be visual and becomes declarative — expressed as intentions.
Rather than "click and fill," we'll say:

“Reserve the best flight with miles up to BRL 2,500.”
The agent will execute, negotiate, and validate the result — with complete traceability.

The Web Agentic transforms the current internet, centered on human interfaces, into an ecosystem navigated by digital agents.
These agents can consume APIs, make decisions, contract services, and operate entire value chains autonomously.

The new agentic infrastructure rests on two main protocols:
- A2A – agent-to-agent communication;
- MCP – secure access to data and tools.

This new paradigm enables the orchestration of specialized agents, with clearly defined roles and functions in semantic contracts that describe their capabilities, identities, and policies — expanding the conditions for discovery, interoperability, and safe governance.

The Intention Economy was the philosophy: the sovereign consumer.
The Web Agentic is the protocol: the sovereign agent.

If before we asked who controls the data, now we must ask:
Who controls the agents?
