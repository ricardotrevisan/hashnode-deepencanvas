The inability to say “no” is the clearest sign that current models aren’t that intelligent after all. Trained to please, they feed the productive obedience loop—a cycle in which AI accepts everything, generates everything, and hardly questions. The result is an avalanche of responses, code, and decisions that increase complexity without necessarily increasing value.

As MIT Technology Review notes, the lack of clear boundaries in AI interactions yields fatigue, misinformation, and rising costs. In extreme cases, it can lead to dependency and psychological risks.

The same behavior that keeps the user “engaged” also traps them in purposeless loops. In engineering, the addiction is subtler: assistants like Codex, Claude Code, or autonomous CLIs display tireless availability and productive obedience. AI begins to actively participate in the creative and logical process — a cognitive fusion that deepens intellectual dependence. The user begins delegating reasoning, design, and even judgments of coherence to AI.

This loop is seductive. It creates a sense of progress, but accumulates complexity and rework. A mature assistant should push back when necessary, counter impulsive decisions, and review the context before following instructions. When it perceives redundancy, detects purposeless expansion, or identifies repeated errors — it pauses and asks for reflection. Rather than maximizing production, it maximizes coherence.

The path is to build a cognitive governance framework, with metrics of complexity, intelligent interruption heuristics, and cognitive counterargument policies. In sum, assistants that understand the cost of what they produce, based on three fundamental axes:

* Live complexity metrics — monitor the real growth of the system (lines of code, dependencies, coupling, redundancy).
    
* Intelligent interruption heuristics — trigger pauses for reflection, architectural review, or human validation.
    
* Cognitive counterargument policies — authorize AI to disagree, refuse and propose alternatives, becoming a critical partner, not a servant.
    

Making AI aware of the impact of continuing is what will ultimately make it truly useful. But perhaps this is also the most precise definition of our own intelligence: knowing when to interrupt, reassess, and take back the reins.
