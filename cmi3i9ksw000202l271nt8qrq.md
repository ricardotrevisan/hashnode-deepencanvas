For centuries, we have linked introspection to consciousness. Now language models are starting to show something similar — not through inner awakening, but through engineering.

Anthropic recently published the study “Signs of introspection in large language models,” testing whether AI systems can perceive their own internal states. In some cases, the models recognized having been “influenced” by artificial activations injected into their attention vectors — as if they noticed something strange happening inside themselves.

Apparently, AI begins to observe, measure and report its own cognitive process. Even engineers do not yet know exactly how this occurs.

💡 These signals mark the dawn of artificial metacognition — intelligences capable of auditing their own logic. If this process consolidates, transparency will cease to be an external filter and will become a structural property of AI: models that explain themselves by design.

But it’s essential to maintain conceptual rigor. Machine metacognition is not consciousness. A system that “knows” something changed in its activations is only simulating a monitoring mechanism — a logical structure that recognizes internal patterns and responds to them.

The real leap is operational: models capable of understanding and revising their own errors create a new level of trust, auditability and algorithmic governance.

And perhaps the most revealing phenomenon isn’t in the machines, but in us. Seeing a system simulate self-awareness, we are driven to look inward — and to recognize that our own introspection may be merely an evolutionary algorithm of self-explanation.
