What if the agent itself could experiment, evaluate, and optimize based on the results it delivers? This is the logic behind Adaptive Decision Optimization (ADO) — the core approach of Agent Lightning, Microsoft's proposal to create truly autonomous agents.

The idea is simple and powerful: apply Reinforcement Learning not only in training the model, but in its ongoing use. A kind of real-time, extended learning that turns every interaction into evolution.

The result is a living learning cycle: the agent acts, measures, compares the result to the expected one, and adjusts its own behavior — without human intervention, only observation and analysis.

Agent Lightning creates an environment where the agent understands not only what to respond, but how to evolve — guided by a reward policy that directs its choices and defines its progress.

Reward Design: If the agent learns based on the stimuli we provide, the real power lies in the design of the rewards — the point where intention meets engineering. It's not enough to teach what to do; you must define why to do it.

We tested this logic with the Self-Optimizable Agent, and the results were clear: the process optimizes in real time as the agent reflects on its decisions — paving the way for systems that not only execute, but reinvent themselves continuously.
