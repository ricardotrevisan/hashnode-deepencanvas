The focus on building code has never been the central value driver in technology. The hyper-segmentation of roles transformed the former Systems Analyst into a constellation of specialists—a move I have always criticized for stifling individual potential. It fed passions for languages, stacks, methodologies, and processes, always with a limited validity: an almost romantic insistence that dissolves with each new generation of paradigms, products, and architectures.

The true value has always resided in the ability to abstract, invent, and synthesize—in product vision, context reading, timing and opportunity. And in letting go.

The results of GDPval, OpenAI's initiative that measures AI models' performance on real-world economic tasks, confirm this point from a contemporary perspective: developers are among the professionals most vulnerable to automation. Coding, testing, documentation, and component integration—the bread-and-butter of daily development—are already performed with human-level or even superior efficiency in many cases.

This finding is, in fact, an opportunity. The synergy of AI agents points to a doubling of productivity for those who see themselves as architects of a new paradigm. We work with teams of capable, voracious, tireless AIs—combining models, media, and layers. The acceleration is tangible, and the line between risk and opportunity depends on perspective: task substitution or deep reconfiguration of roles.

Architecture, security, quality, and systemic coherence become the new differentiators. Distinction will come from technical and strategic curation, guiding models and validating outputs across multiple perspectives: structural performance, logical integrity, and long-term impact.

Automating software writing is inevitable—but it does not replace the power of creation. Machines reproduce patterns; humans perceive gaps. It’s in these nuances, unwritten opportunities, and noise not yet digitized that the difference is made by those who truly create technology.

Reinvention has always been the engine of the field. AI doesn’t destroy it—just shifts its axis.
