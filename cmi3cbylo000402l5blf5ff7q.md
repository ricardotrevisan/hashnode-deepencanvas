# Why We Need to Dissect AI Models Before They Dissect Us

We build gigantic models and, even mastering the algorithms, we don’t know exactly how they decide.

Today I ran into two pieces that brush up against this theme.
One professor created visualizations to show his students what happens in the layers of a neural network — a didactic way to bridge the comprehension gap.
OpenAI has just published a study exploring sparse models as a path to reveal internal mechanisms we don’t see in dense models.

Both illuminate the same reality: we’re using models we don’t truly understand from the inside — and that matters a lot as we relentlessly push to integrate AI into business processes.
The value generated is undeniable, but it adds opacity — a real cognitive debt that isn’t fully quantified yet.

Dense models have billions of connections.
Within them emerge behaviors that create unlikely heuristics, develop emergent objectives, and can produce dangerous responses depending on the context.

This has already been observed in internal circuits of “refusal,” entity tracking, pronoun resolution, and pattern continuation.
The capacity grows; interpretability does not keep up. This is the systemic risk.

Understanding a dense model directly is impractical — like opening a skull and hoping to understand the brain in a day.
The solution is to isolate the complexity.

Sparse models work as lab versions:
fewer connections, same functional principle, much less noise.
They allow observing internal relationships, tracking patterns, understanding mechanisms, and building reliable explanations.
It’s like particle physics: it doesn’t explain the entire universe, but reveals the laws that govern it.

Thus, sparse doesn’t explain the dense, but teaches us how to understand it.
They provide language, a circuitry taxonomy, extraction methods, sufficiency metrics, recurring patterns, and reproducible experiments.
An entire framework of tools we still lack — despite the drive for broad, scalable adoption.

Interesting, isn’t it?
How can an unseen risk easily seem nonexistent?
