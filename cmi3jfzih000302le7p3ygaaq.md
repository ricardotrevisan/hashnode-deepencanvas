Traditional data engineering — ETL, batch, data warehouses, BI — is becoming obsolete. Contemporary models demand data that is faster, cleaner, and contextual.

Data needs to come with metadata that explain its meaning, its origin and the moment it was generated, enabling AI to understand the scenario — and not just the value.

This contextualization is essential to the decision processes to which many of us have devoted ourselves. The absence of context is also a context — and almost always the most dangerous. It is what leads to poor inference, a lack of generalization, and imprecise decisions.

A new semantic layer needs to accompany the data, like a living ontological catalog. “Income” is not “revenue,” which is not “turnover” — and each term must have a formal definition, consistency, and consensus. That rigor benefits both the systems and the people involved in the decisions.

Traceability and provenance come to indicate who, when, and how the data was manipulated. Temporality marks the version, validity, and lifecycle. Other dimensions of this catalog include the relationship between entities — which maps connections and reveals patterns — and continuous enrichment, which keeps a flow of new signals and contexts in this dynamic cycle.

The concept is not new. MIT already advocated this in Total Data Quality Management (TDQM) — the Define → Measure → Analyze → Improve cycle. The difference is that, now, the importance is exponential.

We are delegating processes and decisions to increasingly autonomous models. But if the input isn't perfect, how can you blame AI for the result?

The role of the data engineer is changing. “More contextuality” means that the data stops being an isolated snapshot and becomes a complete story about the event it represents — a high-definition film, with a beginning, middle, end, and metadata that explain the narrative.

Data engineers become meaning engineers. And that changes everything: from architecture to culture, from governance to trust.

Reviewing the data stack, prioritizing use cases that generate real value, structuring metadata as a competitive differentiator, and measuring model drift are no longer best practices — they are minimum maturity requirements.

💡 AI doesn't err: it reflects the context we give it.
