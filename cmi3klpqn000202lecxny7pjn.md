Perhaps the most watched leveraging play in history: the market learning from past tumbles, and the prospect of gains if the balance is maintained.

AMD and OpenAI expanded their partnership: OpenAI will help refine AMD’s Instinct GPUs and, in the future, buy gigawatts of capacity from AMD. Payment won’t be in cash, but via warrants for up to 160 million shares, with vesting tied to price milestones. In other words, stock appreciation will effectively fund future chip purchases.

But this announcement is just the tip of the iceberg. OpenAI has been operating on several fronts with a recurring method: sealing deals that amplify market value, acting simultaneously as customer and supplier.

AMD: hardware + equity upside.

NVIDIA: hardware purchases, with NVIDIA investment for the “The Stargate Project.”

CoreWeave: equity to secure priority access to infrastructure.

Oracle (joint venture with SoftBank): will invest $500 billion in Stargate, with returns via future acquisition of $300 billion in services.

Microsoft: $13 billion in financing and Azure infrastructure, potentially with returns via equity or profit share, and use of Azure as deferred payment.

Each announcement comes with a celebratory tone, but what you see is a tech and financial supply chain being woven with operational, financial, and strategic leverage: scaling without upfront capital, diluting risks across time and partners. A sophisticated, rare cocktail in the market.

Analysts raise viability alarms: circular revenues that don’t reflect real growth can invalidate the whole model.

Still, OpenAI is shaping the future of capturing human intent. With the launch of the Apps SDK, monetization, and the growth of ChatGPT, the company challenges the dominant players, aiming to become the new owner of the board.
