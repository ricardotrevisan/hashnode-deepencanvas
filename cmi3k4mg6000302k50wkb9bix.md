Anthropic helped shift the race’s direction when it concluded: the future lies in feeding better — controlling what the model sees, when it sees it, and with what purpose. Digital curation.

Like us, models have limited attention: as context grows too large, the ability to reason or recall accurately decays — a phenomenon known as context decay (context rot).
Context engineering is born: a discipline that turns data, instructions, and history into an efficient cognitive architecture. Contexts begin to evolve dynamically according to the stage of the process, the state of the flow, and the business need.

Prompts continue to determine the model's behavior and perspective — but now with specific, dynamic, evolving context windows, aligned with the developing objective.

This movement echoes something software engineers have known for decades: modularity, atomicity, and reuse. What used to be service segmentation is now context specialization. Each AI agent operates with specific information — cognitive microservices that cooperate under a central orchestration.

Designing solutions has evolved and now requires:
(1) information pipelines,
(2) cognitive limits (context windows, relevance, compression),
(3) systemic memory curation (what remains vs. what is forgotten), and
(4) coordination of multiple agents (distributed threads of specialized reasoning).

Prompt is a stimulus. Context is an architecture.
Cognitive software is the meeting point of both.

This transition creates a new layer, and the software engineer becomes a cognitive engineer, applying familiar techniques — injection, logs, caching, pipelines — now on semantic data, unstructured and ready for interpretation.

We are witnessing the fusion of software engineering and semantic intelligence, opening space for an era in which code and context coexist as parts of the same intelligent system.

Cognitive Software — it pushes beyond logic to process meaning.
Beautiful!
