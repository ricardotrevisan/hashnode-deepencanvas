Hype is Inevitable

All innovation begins technically before it becomes economically viable.
Hype is the transition ritual: it creates the perception of inevitability that attracts investors, media, and talent — even when the product hasn't delivered yet.
Without this “excess of hope,” many technological cycles wouldn’t even have oxygen to mature.

But when the enthusiasm turns into noise, clarity becomes scarce.
AI agents promise to replace freelancers, developers, and analysts — but in practice, they still function as chaotic copilots: fast, useful, and utterly unable to sustain a project with coherence.

Working with AI today is dealing with a brilliant yet scattered assistant: full of ideas, but unfocused.
AI acts as a knowledge compressor — it accelerates, corrects, suggests — but depends on human direction.
Models “want to please”: they say yes to everything and spew out code in cascades, multiplying complexity without necessarily creating value.
AI proactivity is the new technical risk: the more it says "yes," the more it dilutes the initial purpose.

We're entering the valley of disillusionment — the most fertile point on the adoption curve.
Here, narratives unravel, and only what actually works remains.

It's in this quiet hiatus that technologies reveal their true role: not as substitutes, but as cognitive infrastructure for those who already know what they're doing.
