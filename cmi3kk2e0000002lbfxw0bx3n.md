Interact with any digital service without opening apps, navigating menus, or learning different interfaces. Just chat. Ask, receive direct answers, automate tasks, and access information in multiple languages, almost instantly. This is the power of Conversational Interfaces, transforming how we interact with technology.

The benefits are clear: exponential productivity, intelligent automation, and a fluid experience that goes far beyond what traditional mobile apps can offer. Who would want to open Google to search or deal with app stores full of icons, when an AI can understand and execute your intent directly?

Behind this revolution are the backends, now exposed by the new MCP protocol. Previously, they powered apps, serving as mere delivery interfaces on devices. Today, they also power generative AIs like ChatGPT, which already counts 800 million weekly active users, becoming the central hub for routing human intent.

We’re witnessing a paradigm shift. This isn’t just about technology—it’s about how we express our intentions and how they’re served. Google should be worried.

💡 Spoiler: the next step — AI Operating Systems.
