Companies that have not yet begun developing agents by December 2025 are already two years behind technically and three years behind strategically. This is not opinion; it's a cold diagnosis. The market has crossed an irreversible inflection point: products are no longer digital tools waiting for human interaction. Products have become agents — operational intelligences that execute, decide, prevent, suggest, and correct on behalf of the user.

Between 2023 and the end of 2024, this turn began quietly but devastatingly for those who didn't notice. In 2023, we worked with copilots and chatbots. In 2024, with the emergence of protocols like the MCP and the advances in the agentic web, automation became delegation — flows that talk to each other, tools orchestrated by models, semi-autonomous decisions. Throughout 2025 and into 2026, the winning companies began releasing agents specialized in each critical domain. Now, in 2026, any competitive product operates with at least four intelligences: one operational to handle support, billing, and verifications; one executor to coordinate tasks and integrations; one analytics to review and audit behaviors; and a domain intelligence that carries the company's proprietary knowledge and makes decisions grounded in it. Whoever lacks this is effectively stuck in 2019.

The user has changed even faster than technology. **The 2026 consumer will not be willing to navigate, configure, click, search, or type.** Learning to use a product **will be** a cognitive cost that they will no longer accept paying. Their expectation **will be** direct: “solve this for me, now, without me needing to remember or ask.” Products that depend on explicit intent **will continue to impose** work; products that act first **will continue to win**.

This “acting before” is the new milestone that separates thriving companies from stagnant ones. To understand it, you must abandon the old mental model — where the user is the engine of the system — and adopt the structure that began to dominate in 2025 and solidified in 2026: **intention → need → action**.  
Intention is what the user really wants, even if they don't articulate it.  
Need is what the system must resolve to generate value at the right moment.  
Action is the autonomous execution before an explicit request.

And here's the uncomfortable truth: **declared intention is fragile. Words are noise. The true intention lies in the data — in patterns, frictions, deviations, silences. Waiting for the customer to demonstrate their intention will become a fatal strategic error.**

In this scenario, the Product Manager ceases to be a screen designer and features organizer. Their responsibility becomes orchestrating intelligence. They connect the company's context — products, policies, history, culture — to the real customer context — preferences, patterns, moment, intention. The product ceases to be an interface and becomes an executing intelligence, carrying the company's competence and vision and acting directly in the user's life.

This agent operates in three interdependent layers. The first is intelligence: how it thinks, decides, reflects, learns, and self-corrects. The second are capabilities: everything it can execute via APIs, tools, integrations, and permissions. The third is the product's shell, now reduced to the minimum necessary — only a single control point, not the center of the experience. And to detect intention, the agent reads three kinds of signals: behavioral (patterns, repetition, frictions), contextual (external events, environmental conditions, state variations), and latent (invisible correlations to the user, anomalies and trends). This combination substitutes screens with anticipation protocols. The product observes, interprets, predicts, and acts.

This redefines backlog and metrics. The backlog stops being about delivering features and starts to be about evolving behaviors. Metrics stop measuring usage and start measuring autonomy, anticipation, effectiveness, and reduced effort. Value shifts from interaction to non-interaction: how much the user no longer needs to act because the agent has already done it.

The conclusion is brutal and simple: companies that haven't started developing agents missed the first big wave between 2023 and 2025. Now they compete with organizations that operate three to ten times faster, with less friction, lower cost, higher accuracy, and a structural advantage of anticipation. While some are still debating features, the winning market already runs with active intelligences that connect the company's context and the client's context to act before the user perceives the need.

In this new world, passive products — static, non-cognitive tools — are doomed to obsolescence. The logic of “wait for the customer to demonstrate intent” is dead. **Intent will be detected, not declared.** And true value will emerge precisely at the intersection of what the company knows and what the customer needs, at the moment they don't even realize.

For any executive in 2026, the question isn't anymore “Should we invest in agents?”.  
The real question is:  
**How long can your company keep operating with tools in a market that already runs on intelligence?**
