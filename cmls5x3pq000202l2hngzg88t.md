“What are the most important problems in your field—and why aren’t you working on them?”

That’s the famous *Hamming Question*, formulated in the talk **“You and Your Research”** (1986), by **Richard Hamming**. At first glance, it’s a professional provocation. Yet, on closer analysis, it reveals a striking affinity with the spirit of **Stoicism**.

Hamming wasn’t interested in abstract ambition. For him, a problem is truly important only when it combines significant impact with a plausible attack — that is, a concrete path forward. Grandeur without tractability is nothing more than intellectual fantasy. This stance echoes the classic Stoic distinction, articulated by **Epictetus**, between what depends on us and what does not. It isn’t enough for something to be grand; it must lie within the realm of rational action.

From there, the connection becomes structural. Stoicism isn’t a philosophy of resignation, but of disciplined action. It requires focusing on what’s possible to do, here and now, with the resources and circumstances available. Hamming’s implicit formula — importance as the product of impact and tractability — could be read as a modern rendering of that practical ethic. It’s not the size of the dream that matters, but the combination of relevance and feasibility.

There’s also a second link: the coherence between belief and action. **Marcus Aurelius** insisted that the central problem of moral life is the incongruity between what we know to be right and what we actually do. The Hamming Question exposes exactly that fracture. If you recognize what the central problems in your field are, but devote your time to peripheral topics, you’re misaligned. The question acts as an uncomfortable mirror: the obstacle isn’t external, it’s internal.

This discomfort is essential. Working on central problems is rarely the most comfortable option. They tend to involve greater risk, greater uncertainty, and greater possibility of public failure. They demand intellectual courage — a deeply Stoic virtue. For the Stoics, excellence isn’t about avoiding difficulty, but about acting according to reason, regardless of the immediate psychological cost.

Curiously, Hamming stated that his aim wasn’t to force a shift of domains. Still, in environments like **Bell Labs**, his question often led to deep reorientations. When someone realized that the truly important problems lay outside their current field, the change became a rational consequence. Not impulsively, but through strategic alignment.

The strength of the Hamming Question lies precisely at that intersection of clarity and action. It doesn’t ask for romantic heroism. It asks for clarity. It compels us to confront the difference between what we value in theory and where we invest our energy in practice. In that sense, it functions as a contemporary Stoic exercise: examine one’s choices in light of reason and adjust course as needed.

Ultimately, both Hamming and the Stoics converge on the same principle: working on what truly matters requires mental discipline, honesty with oneself, and focus on what can be effectively transformed. It isn’t about chasing abstract greatness, but about acting strategically where there is real impact and a tangible possibility of progress.

The question remains open — and uncomfortable. And perhaps that discomfort is precisely a sign that it is fulfilling its role.
