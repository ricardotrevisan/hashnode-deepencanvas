Lower computational footprint, faster speed, and reduced cost. Researchers show that ultra-small networks can sustain recursive reasoning, making AI more efficient and viable for deployment near the user, even in environments with restricted bandwidth or privacy-focused settings.

The paper "Less is More: Recursive Reasoning with Tiny Networks" proposes ultra-simplified modules capable of recursive reasoning and performing complex tasks, maintaining or surpassing giants in specific benchmarks.

Biological inspiration: the HRM (Hierarchical Reasoning Model) draws on the human brain, with two recurrent modules: high-level strategic planning and fast, detailed low-level reasoning. Three months later, Samsung proposed the TRM, simplifying to a network of only 2 layers and maintaining or surpassing HRM’s performance. This kind of research shows the power of scientists who observe natural patterns and translate these insights into algorithms, continually redefining AI's competitiveness parameters.

How it works:

- Generates a quick draft of the solution.
- Performs internal recursive reasoning and self-critique.
- Repeatedly tests the answer against the original problem — clearly “think before acting.”

Specialized in deterministic tasks, such as Sudoku, ARC, or maze solving, the TRM does not directly compare to generalist LLMs (like GPT-5, with hundreds of billions of parameters). Still, with only 7 million parameters, it outperforms giant models on specific benchmarks, showing that efficiency and intelligence can go hand in hand without relying on brute force.
