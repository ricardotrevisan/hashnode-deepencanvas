We're entering a new semantic tier: solutions that interpret who is asking, what the intent is, and the context.

Behind this, a quiet revolution is unfolding with the adoption of MCP. Launched last November and adopted by major players, the protocol acts as a bridge, exposing services and data from the Digital Economy directly to AI Agents.

The LLM + MCP combo forms a powerful binomial: AI systems interact with others naturally, maintaining API consistency. Imagine an LLM asking: “List customers with high risk and overdue by more than 90 days.”

The Agent understands the context, validates permissions, translates the intent into multiple queries, and maintains session memory. Thus, subsequent requests could be: “From these, show the top 10 highest values.” — in other words, semantic proactivity, a topic for another conversation.

But the Agentic Agent not only interprets — it executes real actions, such as scheduling meetings, issuing tickets, generating charges, or processing payments, for example.

The result? Smart, contextualized interactions that put actions in motion. Awesome!

And you, has your company started exposing services this way?
