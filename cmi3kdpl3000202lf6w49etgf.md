The focus on writing code has never been the core source of value in technology. The hyper-segmentation of roles transformed the old Systems Analyst into a constellation of specialists — a move I’ve long criticized for stifling individual potential. It fed passions for languages, stacks, methodologies, and processes, always with limited validity: an almost romantic insistence, dissolved with each new generation of paradigms, products, and architectures.

The true value has always resided in abstraction, invention, and synthesis — in product vision, in reading context, in the sense of timing and opportunity. And in letting go.

The results of GDPval, an OpenAI initiative that measures AI models’ performance on real economic tasks, confirm this point from a contemporary perspective: developers are among the professionals most vulnerable to automation. Coding, testing, documenting, and integrating components — the daily bread of development — are already performed with human-equivalent or superior efficiency in many cases.

This realization is, in fact, an opportunity. The synergy of AI agents points to doubling the productivity of those who see themselves as architects of a new paradigm. We work with capable, voracious, tireless AI teams — blending models, modalities, and layers. The acceleration is visible, and the line between risk and opportunity depends on perspective: task substitution or deep reconfiguration of roles.

Architecture, security, quality, and systemic coherence become the new territories of differentiation. The spotlight will come from technical and strategic curation, guiding models and validating outputs from multiple perspectives: structural performance, logical integrity, and long-term impact.

Automating software writing is inevitable — but it does not replace the power of creation. Machines reproduce patterns; humans perceive gaps. It is in these nuances, unwritten opportunities, and noises not yet digitized that the difference is made for those who build real technology.

Reinvention has always been the engine of the field.
AI does not destroy it — it simply shifts its axis.
