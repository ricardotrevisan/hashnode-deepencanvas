The ongoing change is the fastest and most imperceptible among all shifts that network technology has experienced. In short, the Web is ceasing to be an interface exclusively for humans and, quietly, becoming a largely agent-executable environment. And the process is advancing at a rapid pace, with new standards being defined, agents acting in the transformation itself and rebuilding layers that enable their own understanding: syntax and semantics tuned to the needs of natural language models.

Operationally, the aim is to eliminate friction, with agents welcomed as first-class users, just as we are today. The result is clear: greater efficiency in understanding the purpose of each node published on the network and in identifying tools with which agents can transact.

The new core of competition:

Thus, efficiency (time) walks hand in hand with reducing token usage (cost), since, with greater objectivity and frictionless access, less content in the context window is required.

For thirty years, the Web was optimized for eyes, clicks, scrolling, mouse hovering, forms, funnels and conversion. All was to “be seen.” Even when we introduced “web apps,” the essence remained: a presentation layer that is “user-friendly,” but entirely “human-centric.”

And the last decade of analytical efforts only solidified this model, pairing machine learning with associations that would also work when seen by the user. Expanding the relationship with consumption-based offers has become the rule: statistics used to drive human attention.

But, without most of us realizing it, this priority has shifted. An agent doesn’t want to see storefronts. It wants to obtain a minimally reliable context, understand whether intents are aligned, and then execute an action with safety and a result.

If any portion of the Web continues to require agents to “pretend to be human” — i.e., forcing them to perform web scraping, DOM analysis, rendering, sometimes OCR, forcing them to solve CAPTCHAs and circumvent bot detection — friction will remain deliberate and, as a result, the computation and operational costs explode. The result? Little to no traction and poor outcomes: slow, costly, fragile, and prone to error. The agent is already the intermediary between your business and the customer. If it cannot perform in your business, what tends to happen?

What changed?

The Web, by design, was still a mix of real content, layout and styles, tracking and personalization scripts, A/B experiments, and various anti-bot and anti-automation strategies.

This last point is particularly relevant because analytics relied on pure human interaction to collect and try to identify intent, capture attention, or deepen engagement with offers suggested by the model itself. Automation here implied adversarial behavior: without someone watching the offer linked, the gears of that engine would grind to a halt.

The Web Agentic defines a layer where sites expose intent, tools, and structured data, without requiring UI theater.

The new showcase exposes actionable items (tools), data that can be consumed (schemas), constraints (permissions, rate limits, minimum context), methods to authenticate and authorize an agent, and how to return verifiable results.

If the human Web was centered on pages, the Web Agentic defines a new paradigm, focused on capabilities.

Still, friction will be inevitable, particularly on platforms that live on human contact — anti-agent destinations by design — as the economic model has long been set that way. This includes retailers and closed e-commerce ecosystems. Direct human-traffic consumers feed behavioral signals as fuel for their recommendation and cross-sell strategies. In that environment, an external agent is a threat: it shortens the “store time,” kills impulse, and reduces the value of the collected data.

But the contradiction is growing: if the user agent becomes the main interaction channel, blocking agents is equivalent to blocking users — worse, silently. The likely adaptation is to create agentic layers under the retailer’s control and, of course, redesign their analytical pipelines for the new model.

This new paradigm also reorganizes the economic model:

In this scenario, SEO also transforms. It’s no longer just about ranking pages for humans to click from search engines, but about structuring data and capabilities so that agents can trust, cite, and execute the available services.

The traditional funnel — impression, click, navigation, conversion — gives way to another flow: capability indexing, reliability-based selection, tool execution, and result verification.

So, it’s no longer about being found. It’s about being activated.

This transition points to the practical realization of VRM (Vendor Relationship Management).

If CRM has always organized the world around the supplier, the Web Agentic reorganizes the flow around the user’s intent. The fundamental unit ceases to be the page and becomes the intent expressed in a few words.

The agent becomes the permanent mediator between user and market. It negotiates, compares, executes, and audits. It returns to suppliers more often than a human would manually. And in doing so, it shifts the balance of relational power.

The Web that was born as a document, became an application and then a platform, is now becoming the infrastructure of intent.

The showcase remains.

But the transaction, increasingly, will be executed by those who understand the intent — and not merely by those who capture attention.
