Today’s topic is product and the future — looking at the real change happening and that exciting sense of satisfaction.

Abhishek Mathur, from Figma, joked that we’re in the AI MS-DOS era and that the “Windows moment” is still to come. The comparison is flattering but insufficient. It makes us think about interface evolution, when in reality we’re walking toward the end of interfaces as a concept. What’s emerging isn’t a new way to point and click, but a continuous layer that lives around us, always present, multimodal, anticipatory, dissolved into daily life without demanding attention.

Prompts, screens, and menus — all of this is residue from a time when humans had to adapt to software. That era is ending. The combination of computer vision, natural audio, prosody, intent detection, and autonomous agents pushes interaction into a territory where AI sees, understands, and acts before touch. It isn’t an evolution of UX. It’s the suppression of the very idea of an interface. If we still want metaphors, we’re not heading toward Windows; we’re moving to a distributed, cheap, and ubiquitous Jarvis.

The infiltration has already begun, but discreetly. While the hype noise distracts, what really matters is that interpreting context has become trivial — and that makes it feasible to embed AI in virtually any product. The car adjusts behavior to your driving style, the home to your mood, your workouts to your posture. Meetings, emails, messages, and calendars stop feeling fragmented and become a single interpreted organism. Even a hair dryer can set its power based on the cord and the surroundings. The boundary between “software” and “daily life” simply dissolves.

As models converge in capability, the competitive axis stops being technical. It becomes presence. The advantage is in being with the person all the time, understanding their context without resets, carrying long-term semantic memory, acting before the request, and anticipating needs without explanation. What we used to call personalization today becomes something deeper: a narrative understanding of the person, from the past to the immediate goal.

With this, agents cease to be task executors and begin operating around intentions. The equation becomes: person → intention → agent → action, with no screens in between. They plan, execute, evaluate, and adjust, incrementally, until the goal is achieved. And then an inevitable question arises: not “what can AI do,” but “how far do you want it to decide for you?” In practice, I always conclude that today’s challenge in building an assistant isn’t making it capable; it’s constraining it.

When this layer matures, the business world shifts axis. There is no longer a user accessing services. There is a continuous relationship, mediated by an agent that knows history, understands context, tracks intent, and eliminates friction. Customer service, product, and support stop being departments; they become a single, living, permanent flow. It’s the Agentic Web in its purest state — not a promise, but infrastructure.

In the end, the milestone of this new era isn’t the technical competence of the models. It’s their operational invisibility. AI becomes real infrastructure when the user doesn’t even notice the work happening, when the flow is so natural it seems given, when the complexity simply disappears. It’s not a leap in UX. It’s the complete removal of cognitive effort. The era of interaction is ending; what comes next is the era of coexistence.
