The discussion about the “AI bubble” gained momentum with the question: have productivity gains actually appeared? While the market inflates valuations based on promises, the real economy still shows tepid results.

A bubble, after all, is when investment exceeds the economic value generated—and yes, there are signs of it. But perhaps we won’t see a “crash,” and instead a correction of expectations. Enter the classic script: renewed hype, promises shifted to the future, and narratives that keep the enthusiasm alive (from space-age CPUs to faith in qubits, ignoring the scarcity of algorithms and quantum data).

The METR study illustrates the dilemma well: 16 experienced developers lost 20% of productivity with AI. But that’s natural — we’re evaluating an incremental innovation tool in tasks that didn’t have bottlenecks. It’s like testing a calculator in a times-tables contest.

I conclude that AI is still a multiplier of capacity, not an immediate substitute. Corrections will come, as the J-Curve and the Gartner Hype Cycle show, but it is in the “Slope of Enlightenment”—that moment of quiet after the hype—where the true transformation happens.
