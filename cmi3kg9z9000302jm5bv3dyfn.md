Maybe the most watched leverage game in history: the market has learned from past tumbles, and the prospect of gains if the balance holds.

AMD and OpenAI have expanded their partnership: OpenAI will help improve AMD's Instinct GPUs and, in the future, buy gigawatts of capacity from AMD. Payment won't be in cash, but via warrants for up to 160 million shares, with vesting linked to price targets. In other words, stock appreciation will practically fund future chip purchases.

But this announcement is only the tip of the iceberg. OpenAI has been operating on several fronts with a recurring method: striking deals that amplify market value, while acting simultaneously as customer and supplier.

AMD: hardware + equity tied to appreciation.

NVIDIA: hardware purchases, with NVIDIA's investment for the “The Stargate Project”.

CoreWeave: equity to guarantee priority access to infrastructure.

Oracle (joint venture with SoftBank): will invest $500 billion in Stargate, with returns via future acquisition of $300 billion in services.

Microsoft: $13 billion in financing and Azure infrastructure, possibly with returns via equity or profit share, and use of Azure as deferred payment.

Each announcement comes with a celebratory tone, but what unfolds is a tech-and-finance supply chain woven through operational, financial, and strategic leverage: scaling without upfront capital, diluting risks across time and partners. A sophisticated, rare blend in the market.

Analysts are raising alerts about viability: circular revenues that don’t reflect real growth can undermine the entire model.

Still, OpenAI is shaping the future of capturing human intent. With the Apps SDK launch, monetization advances, and ChatGPT’s growth, the company challenges the dominant players, aiming to own the board.
