### (And Why Many Projects Die at Birth)

The most common mistake I see today is simple but devastating: **“adopting AI” has become a strategy in itself**.  
And that was never a strategy.  
It’s direction without a destination, movement without purpose, anxiety dressed up as innovation.

The origin is clear. The hype has its reasons — it attracts funding, makes headlines, accelerates visionaries.  
But its side effects are poisonous: it creates illusion, generates corporate FOMO, and pushes entire companies into blind initiatives.

It’s precisely at this point that those who **do real AI** separate from those who merely **do AI marketing**.

A healthy balance requires investment grounded in **real expectations**, a concrete PDCA, and discipline to avoid the *point of no return* — that threshold where costs are committed, structural decisions become irreversible, and the company is trapped in artificial dependencies.  
The names vary — *irreversibility threshold*, *commitment lock-in*, *sunk cost fallacy* — precisely because this error repeats tirelessly in the market.

My personal experience is a synthesis of this paradox: **extremely rapid acceleration with inevitable cognitive instability**.  
AI multiplies, but destabilizes. It delivers extraordinary speed, but requires extreme vigilance to identify the moment when complexity scales without producing real results.

And when you dive into this sandy terrain, some competencies become non-optional:

- keep track of the recency and updates of the models for your stack;  
- notice when the model **seems to know**, but is just projecting confidence — because with a 10% domain deviation, everyone compensates with conviction, never with humility;  
- identify when syntactic coherence remains intact while operational coherence has broken — and generic answers or invalid solutions begin to appear;  
- master deeply what is being asked, so you aren’t dragged down by the collapse;  
- plan before “releasing the dogs of war”;  
- remember that AI **does not have short-term functional memory** — each output is just the best statistical guess given the accumulated context.

In short: it’s the engineer, not the model, who must remember, correct, and redirect.  
It’s the engineer who sustains the *skill gap* needed to prevent degeneration loops.

And when this balance is well struck, the results are astonishing:  
**4 to 6 weeks of work transformed into a single week.**  
You’ll not want to stop, not even to sleep.

But this maturity is rare.  
Rare enough to explain why so many companies succumb to the hype and live in the **AI Theater**.

On the surface: *success stories*, *radical automation*, *miraculous ROI*.  
On the inside: models breaking on real tasks, unstable pipelines, voice agents collapsing at a simple phonetic variation, and managers terrified of looking incompetent.

And here enters a phenomenon well described in the book **_Influencer_** (by Kerry Patterson and team): the so-called **Project Chicken**.  
It’s the invisible political game that unfolds when everyone knows a project is melting down, but no one wants to be the first to admit it.  
In the *Project Chicken*, managers watch one another in silence, waiting for who will “blink” first — because the one who speaks first becomes the pessimist, the “not collaborative,” the one responsible for spoiling the dream.

This mechanism applies with surgical precision to corporate AI projects: **no one wants to be the first to break the narrative.**

And the problem doesn’t end there — it worsens in organizational cultures that **penalize error**.

In such environments, admitting a deviation, recognizing a technical limitation, or suggesting a different path becomes a personal risk.  
And when error turns into punishment, the worst side effect appears: **complete paralysis**.

No one tries anything new.  
No one questions assumptions.  
No one proposes route adjustments.  
No one confronts the hype.  
Instead, people retreat into bureaucracy:

- endless meetings;  
- approval committees that don’t approve;  
- polished slides that say nothing;  
- processes created to avoid risk — not to create value.

The new becomes forbidden — not by an explicit rule, but by widespread fear.  
And thus, to avoid making mistakes, innovation is shunned.  
The status quo becomes a fortress, not for efficiency, but for self-preservation.

And none of this is truly new. Corporate history is a graveyard of grand slogans that followed the same cycle: **hype, blind adoption, frustration, silence, and years later, real maturity**.

How many times have we seen this happen?

- **SOA** promised to cure all fragmentation of systems — and turned into years of consulting, costly integrations, and projects halted by excessive complexity.  
- **Agile** became a magic word — but in many places it turned into colorful post-its, hollow ceremonies, and no culture of learning.  
- **Smart** (cities, devices, energy) was pitched as a revolution — and often ended up as sophisticated PowerPoints with little real execution.  
- **Big Data** arrived with promises of omniscience — and dissolved into underutilized clusters, Hadoop dead, and teams that never knew what to measure.  
- **Analytics** became a mantra — but in many companies it limited to dashboards no one uses, metrics no one understands, and KPIs that don’t move decisions.

The pattern is always the same:  
**the narrative grows faster than the organization's ability to absorb the technology.**

And when expectations blow up before discipline, technology becomes the scapegoat.  
That happened with SOA, Agile, Big Data, Analytics… and now it’s happening with AI.

The difference is that, this time, technology is truly exponential — and the consequences of error are faster and deeper.  
Maturity cannot take a decade as in previous cycles. Now, either companies learn fast, or they’ll fall behind without realizing it.

My latest case exemplifies this perfectly.

I built a 100% voice-based negotiator: MCP integrated, CRM consumed in real time, tailored offers, flawless synthetic voice. While AI **spoke**, it was brilliant.  
But when it needed to **listen** to a real customer — accent, background noise, GSM compression, horn, latency, overlapping speech — everything collapsed.  
The stack was ready to *speak*, but not to *listen*.  
That’s the current frontier. And it only reveals itself when you reach it.

But frontiers are not failures.  
Failure is stopping there.

There are pragmatic solutions:

- don’t ask for complex voice confirmations;  
- send confirmatory elements (tokens, codes, known data);  
- use DTMF when precision is critical;  
- apply fuzzy matching when ambiguity is inevitable;  
- prepare stage-specific fallbacks for each sensitive step.

In the end, what destroys an initiative isn’t technological imperfection — it’s **lack of commitment, discipline, and creative persistence**.

AI doesn’t replace work.  
AI amplifies those who keep working.

Because, in the real world, technology never had to be perfect.  
It only needs to generate **productivity, efficiency, cost reduction, and scale**.

And here’s the truth few articulate:  
**AI works in layers.**  
It’s sophisticated in some areas, limited in others.  
It works 80% of the time, breaks in 20%.  
And navigating these edges is human work.

The opposite is the worst possible stance: hoping it goes wrong for everyone, resisting change to avoid losing control, or avoiding relearning.

But not discovering the current frontier is, in itself, the greatest risk:  
it means not taking any risk — and therefore risking everything.

Have you reviewed the budget for the next cycle?
